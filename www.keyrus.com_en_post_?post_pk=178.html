        the Keyrus Group recorded consolidated revenues of €173.1m as at 31 December 2014, representing an increase of 9.0% compared to those as at 31 December 2013 based on reported figures, and a growth of 5.5% at constant structure and exchange rates, driven by both sectors of activity.
In the 4th quarter, consolidated revenues were €49.8m, an increase of 17.3% as compared with the 4th quarter of 2013 (+9.5% at constant structure and exchange rates).
The Large Account activities increased by 22.4% in the 4th quarter of 2014 (+11.3% at constant structure and exchange rates) and by 10.3% for the year 2014 (+4.8% at constant structure and exchange rates). This solid increase in Large Account activities in the 4th quarter can be explained notably by more favorable market trends and by the demand being aligned with the Group's portfolio of solutions/services based on 3 pillars of offerings: Data Intelligence (Business Intelligence, Information Management, Big Data & Analytics, CPM/EPM), Digital Experience (Digital Strategy and Performance, Digital Commerce, Customer Relations & Digital CRM) and Management & Transformation.
Based on reported figures for the 4th quarter 2014, the revenues include €2.1m linked to external growth achieved in 2014.
The Mid-Market activities increased by 4.6% in the 4th quarter (likewise in organic terms) and by 5.5% for the year (+7.3% organic growth). This organic growth reflects an upturn in the Small- and Medium-Sized Businesses and Intermediate-Sized Companies market in 2014, with notably a significant rise in licence sales over the financial year (+30%) as compared with the 2013 financial year, and with services and maintenance activities having held up well. Nevertheless, the 4th quarter saw a slowdown in orders, with a market which will remain driven, in 2015, by the new "DSN" ("Déclaration Sociale Nominative") regulations.
The Group's Large Account and Mid-Market activities represent respectively 73.7% and 26.3% of the consolidated revenues of the Group in 2014.
International business accounted for 32.0% of total revenues as against 31.6% for the 2013 financial year.
Eric Cohen, President and CEO, comments: "The growth during the 2014 financial year bears out our strategy of investing around our three pillars of offerings: Data Intelligence, Digital Experience and Management & Transformation, which positions Keyrus with a value proposal unique on the market. In 2015, our main challenge shall lie in the cross-fertilization of our areas of know-how for the benefit of our clients, and in the pursuit of the industrialization of our delivery on a Group scale. On the Mid-Market segment, our objective will be to maintain our solid level of performance and to prepare for the technological shift which is also occurring in management solutions for the Enterprise."
 Keyrus will publish its 2014 annual results on 14 April 2015 after the market close.
